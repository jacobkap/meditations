# Overview

View the wisdom of Marcus Aurelius through his quotes from his book Meditations.

## Installation

You can install meditations from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jacobkap/meditations")
```

## Example

This is how to use this simple package. `meditations()` will print a random quote from the book. 

```{r example}
meditations::meditations()
```

Choose a number between 1 and 507 (there are only 507 quotes) and it will print that specific quote(s).

```{r}
meditations::meditations(5)
```
